#	This file can be used to allow you to customise your	#
#	shell environment. 					#
#								#
#	ARCCA strongly advise against using 'module' commands	#
#	within this file as it can lead to issues as well as	#
#	general confusion when using multiple versions		#
#	of a specific piece of software (or when revisting	# 
#	a piece of software after several months).		#
#								#
#	If the modifications are for a specific piece of	# 
#	software we recommend creating a shell script to	# 
#	customise your environment that is specific to that 	#
#	programs requirement.					#
#				 				#
#	i.e.							#
#								#
#		matlab_2008_environment.sh			#
#								#
#	Place your customisation for a specific program		#
#	within this file and execute it before using the 	#
#	program interactively. 					#
#								#
#	i.e.							#
#								#
#		sh matlab_2008_environment.sh			#
#								#
#	If you are setting up an environment for job execution 	#
#	please use the module commands within you qsub   	#
#	submission script.					#
#								#
#	Customisations within this file should be general	#
#	and not specific to an application (i.e. changing 	#
#	your colour scheme).					#
#								#
#	If you require any advice with setting up your 		#
#	environment please do not hesitate to contact the 	#
#	ARCCA team (arcca@cardiff.ac.uk).			#
